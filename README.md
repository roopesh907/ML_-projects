# üéØ Student Score Predictor

This project predicts a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied, using a simple Linear Regression model.

## üìä Dataset
- A small dataset of 25 samples.
- Feature: `Hours Studied`
- Target: `Scores Achieved`

## üí° Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Data visualization (scatter plot)
3. Model training using scikit-learn
4. Model evaluation (MAE)
5. Predicting scores for custom input

## üîç Sample Prediction
For 9.25 hours studied, the predicted score is **~92.90**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìå Conclusion
This project shows how even a simple Linear Regression model can give meaningful predictions when there's a strong correlation between the features and target. It's a great starting point for understanding supervised learning.
