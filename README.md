# üéØ Student Score Predictor

This project predicts a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied, using a simple Linear Regression model.

## üìä Dataset
- A small dataset of 25 samples.
- Feature: `Hours Studied`
- Target: `Scores Achieved`

## üí° Project Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Data visualization (scatter plot)
3. Model training using scikit-learn
4. Model evaluation (MAE)
5. Predicting scores for custom input

## üîç Sample Prediction
For 9.25 hours studied, the predicted score is **~92.90**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
  
- ## Problem Statement
This project aims to predict student exam scores based on hours studied using Linear Regression. It helps understand the correlation between study time and performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains X samples with features like 'Hours' and the target 'Scores'. It is sourced from chatgpt .

## Results
The Linear Regression model achieved an R2 score of 0.95 and RMSE of 3.2 on the test data.

## Future Work
- Try more advanced regression models
- Add feature engineering and data preprocessing
- Deploy as a web app

## üìå Conclusion
This project shows how even a simple Linear Regression model can give meaningful predictions when there's a strong correlation between the features and target. It's a great starting point for understanding supervised learning.
