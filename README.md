# 🎯 Student Score Predictor

A simple machine learning project that predicts student marks based on study hours using Linear Regression.

## 📌 Project Description

This project is built using Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to train a linear regression model to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. The model is trained and tested on a sample dataset with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts user input: Study hours
- Predicts score using a trained `.pkl` model
- Evaluates model with Mean Squared Error and R² Score
- Visualizes data and regression line using matplotlib

## 📊 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab
2. Run all cells step-by-step
3. Enter custom input to predict score
4. Evaluate the model metrics at the end

## 📁 Files

- `Student_score_predictor.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `student_score_model.pkl` – Saved trained model (can be used for deployment)

## 🧠 Model Performance

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 25.37
- **R² Score:** 0.92

## 📸 Sample Output

> Enter the number of study hours: **9.5**  
> Predicted Score: **95.1**
