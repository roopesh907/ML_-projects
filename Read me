## üìò Projects Included

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Student Score Predictor

- **Objective**: Predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours studied.
- **Algorithm Used**: Linear Regression
- **Dataset**: Supervised regression dataset (Hours vs Scores)
- **Key Steps**:
  - Data Cleaning and Visualization
  - Train-Test Split
  - Linear Regression Model Training
  - Evaluation using R¬≤ Score and MAE
- **Result**:
  - Achieved high prediction accuracy on test data
  - Plotted regression line and compared predicted vs actual scores

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health Status Classifier

- **Objective**: Classify individuals‚Äô mental health status based on questionnaire scores (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7, DASS-21).
- **Algorithms Used**: SVM (with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV)
- **Dataset**: Mental health metrics with labeled status (0, 1, 2, 3)
- **Key Steps**:
  - Preprocessing: Scaling, cleaning, label encoding
  - Model Selection: Tried Random Forest, then fine-tuned SVM
  - Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
- **Best Model**:
  - **Tuned SVM**
  - Accuracy: `92.0%`
  - F1 Score: `91.89%`
  - Saved model using `joblib` for deployment
